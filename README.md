umbraco port to Mono

### Welcome to the umbraco port for mono.

For the basics, please have a look at the wiki: 
https://github.com/m57j75/umbracoMono/wiki


You can find work on each ported (or porting) version of Umbraco
as a branch, 
e.g. 4.7.2 -> https://github.com/m57j75/umbracoMono/tree/u4.7.2

# Branch notes
This branch is now closed. 6.0.x development has been moved to 6.0.6.

# Working approach 
This repository snapshots, umbraco release versions 
from the original codeplex repository: http://umbraco.codeplex.com/

This retains the original commit history.
