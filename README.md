umbraco port to Mono

### Welcome to the umbraco port for mono.

Please have a look at the wiki: 
https://github.com/cankoluman/umbracoMono/wiki

This site replaces the old repository at:
https://github.com/cankoluman/umbraco-mono

You can find work on each ported (or porting) version of Umbraco
as a branch, 
e.g. 4.7.2 -> https://github.com/cankoluman/umbracoMono/tree/u4.7.2


# Working approach 
This repository snapshots, umbraco release versions 
from the original codeplex repository: http://umbraco.codeplex.com/

This retains the original commit history.

At present we have 4.7.2 and 4.11.3, with 4.7.2 being in beta 1, 
and 4.11.3 being newly added.

Our changes are added on top of the existing commit history.

The fork on umbraco.codeplex has now been deleted.
