umbraco port to Mono

### Welcome to the umbraco port for mono.

Please have a look at the wiki: 
https://github.com/m57j75/umbracoMono/wiki

This site replaces the old repository at:
https://github.com/m57j75/umbraco-mono

You can find work on each ported (or porting) version of Umbraco
as a branch, 
e.g. 4.7.2 -> https://github.com/m57j75/umbracoMono/tree/u4.7.2

# Branch Notes
Beta-1 release. Release comments can be found here:
<a href="http://www.strawberryfin.co.uk/blog/2012/11/19/beta-1-release-now-available/" target="_blank">Beta-1-release-now-available</a>

# Working approach 
This repository snapshots, umbraco release versions 
from the original codeplex repository: http://umbraco.codeplex.com/

This retains the original commit history.

At present we have 4.7.2 and 4.11.3, with 4.7.2 being in beta 1, 
and 4.11.3 being newly added.

Our changes are added on top of the existing commit history.

There is also a corresponding fork on umbraco.codeplex:
http://umbraco.codeplex.com/SourceControl/network/forks/m57j75/umbracoMono

However, syncing the two repos is proving difficult for a variety of 
reasons. And I may drop the mercurial fork in the near future as its 
management is requiring a lot of time.
