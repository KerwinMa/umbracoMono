umbraco port to Mono

### Welcome to the umbraco port for mono.

For the basics, please have a look at the wiki: 
https://github.com/cankoluman/umbracoMono/wiki


You can find work on each ported (or porting) version of Umbraco
as a branch, 
e.g. 4.7.2 -> https://github.com/cankoluman/umbracoMono/tree/u4.7.2

# Branch notes
u6.0.3 works except for Lucene, and an intermittent Xml Cache issue.
However, due to its security issues u6.0.3 is not recommended for production.
This branch is now closed. 6.0.x development has been moved to 6.0.6.

# Working approach 
This repository snapshots, umbraco release versions 
from the original codeplex repository: http://umbraco.codeplex.com/

This retains the original commit history.
