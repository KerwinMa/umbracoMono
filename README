Umbraco CMS Mono Port
-------------------------------------------------

This is the community port of the Umbraco CMS to mono. 

Umbraco is an excellent and extesible .NET based CMS. With this port,
we are hoping that the Umbraco CMS will become available to a wider 
audience on Linux, OSX, and other platforms capable of running mono.

Prerequisites:
* mono 2.11 and above to compile
* Apache or nginx, and mono with fast-cgi support.

Port Version(s) Information:
Umbraco 4.7.2 - completed
This port focused on getting the CMS across with the minimum amount of 
changes to the Windows .NET code base.

Umbraco 4.9.x - planned
This port will focus on platform specific optimisations where possible.
It is anticipated to differ form the Windows .NET code base.

More details coming later...
